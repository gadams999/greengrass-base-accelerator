# Greengrass Accelerator Base

This repo contains a minimal deployment of Greengrass in AWS via the Cloud Development Kit (CDK) along with running Greengrass in a docker container.

It is used as scaffold for creating new accelerators, and will be updated as needed to refine constructs, versions, etc.
